					<p>We never have access to your funds, all we have is one vote in a 
					cryptographic M of N transaction. Basically, this means 
					that if both you and the other person reach agreement the 
					Bitcoins can be released. In the event of disagreeemnt 
					we can cast our vote to release or refund the Bitcoins.</p>

					<h3>Designed to be easy to use.</h3>

					<p>M of N cryptography can be a bit confusing the first time you use it. 
					We've tried to make the process as semmless as possible for both 
					the buyer and the seller. We are on hand to help 
					with any issues you have.</p>
